Here is a sample data file which may be used for
the main program maincirc.c:

3

2 1 50 0
-1 -1 1
2 0 1
5 1 1

3 1 50 1
-1 -1 -4
2 0 2
5 1 -5
2 2 1

This is what the numbers mean:

3 how many Bezier curves to draw

2 degree of first curve
 1 flag: plot control polygon (don't plot if set to 0)
 50 how many points to plot
 0 flag: don't plot complementary segment (do if set to 1)

-1 -1 1 homogeneous coordinates of first control point
2 0 1   homogeneous coordinates of second control point
5 1 1   ...

	same for second curve (a wild one)
3 1 50 1
-1 -1 -4
2 0 2
5 1 -5
2 2 1

	same for third curve (a tame one)
3 1 50 1

-1 0 1
0 1 2
1 0 1
1 -2 1
